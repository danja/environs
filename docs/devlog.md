Whoop whoop! Great idea!

Hook up Drawing Robot, Robot Car, cameras etc to environs server!

So anyone can draw things or move robot

Cameras periodically take photos, upload to server

environs becomes my own IoT

Heh, I had intended to hook the devices to Web at some point anyway (in fact I already have Chatterbox doig that to some extent). By approaching this from a completely different direction, I think I will have a nicely consistent solution.
